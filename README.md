## 👨‍💻 Mission
Create a portfolio page to show off my skills.

## 🌐 Application
<a href="https://pr1me-e1gh7.github.io/">Link to the App</a>

## 💻 User Experience
Upon loading the homepage, users will be presented with a navbar (which includes a link to my github page (shown as David Caro), the About section, the Projects section, the Contact section, and a link to my Resume), the About page content, and a footer with multiple social links on displayed with their appropriate icons. Each section will load dynamically on the page when the user clicks on them in the navbar. The About section includes various selling points for employers to consider when hiring. The Projects section includes links to various projects I have and are working on. When the title is clicked the user will be taken to the repo for those projects, and when the photo is clicked the user will be taken to the live application (or the repo if there is none). In the Contact section, the user is provided my email (presented as a link that changes to white when hovered over) should they choose to send an inquiry.
